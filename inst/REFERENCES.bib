We then applied tests with a quality control system (QCS) developed for the detection, correction and possible replacement of suspicious data. Both the applied gap filling technique and the QCS showed that it was possible to solve two of the biggest problems found in time series of daily data measured in meteorological stations: the generation of plausible values for each variable of interest, in order to remedy the absence of observations, and how to detect and allow proper correction of suspicious values arising from observations.},

            This paper describes a comprehensive set of fully automated quality assurance (QA) procedures for observations of daily surface temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth. The QA procedures are being applied operationally to the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily dataset. Since these data are used for analyzing and monitoring variations in extremes, the QA system is designed to detect as many errors as possible while maintaining a low probability of falsely identifying true meteorological events as erroneous. The system consists of 19 carefully evaluated tests that detect duplicate data, climatological outliers, and various inconsistencies (internal, temporal, and spatial). Manual review of random samples of the values flagged as errors is used to set the threshold for each procedure such that its false-positive rate, or fraction of valid values identified as errors, is minimized. In addition, the tests are arranged in a deliberate sequence in which the performance of the later checks is enhanced by the error detection capabilities of the earlier tests. Based on an assessment of each individual check and a final evaluation for each element, the system identifies 3.6 million (0.24\%) of the more than 1.5 billion maximum/minimum temperature, precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth values in GHCN-Daily as errors, has a false-positive rate of 1\%−2\%, and is effective at detecting both the grossest errors as well as more subtle inconsistencies among elements.},

Despite the growing availability of tools of relevance for DQA in the R language, a systematic comparison of their functionalities is missing. Therefore, we review R packages related to data quality (DQ) and assess their scope against a DQ framework for observational health studies. Based on a systematic search, we screened more than 140 R packages related to DQA in the Comprehensive R Archive Network. From these, we selected packages which target at least three of the four DQ dimensions (integrity, completeness, consistency, accuracy) in a reference framework. We evaluated the resulting 27 packages for general features (e.g., usability, metadata handling, output types, descriptive statistics) and the possible assessment’s breadth. To facilitate comparisons, we applied all packages to a publicly available dataset from a cohort study. We found that the packages’ scope varies considerably regarding functionalities and usability. Only three packages follow a DQ concept, and some offer an extensive rule-based issue analysis. However, the reference framework does not include a few implemented functionalities, and it should be broadened accordingly. Improved use of metadata to empower DQA and user-friendliness enhancement, such as GUIs and reports that grade the severity of DQ issues, stand out as the main directions for future developments.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Accurate estimation of missing daily precipitation data remains a difficult task. A wide variety of methods exists for infilling missing values, but the percentage of gaps is one of the main factors limiting their applicability. The present study compares three techniques for filling in large amounts of missing daily precipitation data: spatio-temporal kriging (STK), multiple imputation by chained equations through predictive mean matching (PMM), and the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time that extreme missingness (\&gt;90\%) has been considered. Different percentages of missing data and missing patterns are tested in a large dataset drawn from 112 rain gauges in the period 1975–2017. The results show that both STK and RF can handle extreme missingness, while PMM requires larger observed sample sizes. STK is the most robust method, suitable for chronological missing patterns. RF is efficient under random missing patterns. Model evaluation is usually based on performance and error measures. However, this study outlines the risk of just relying on these measures without checking for consistency. The RF algorithm overestimated daily precipitation outside the validation period in some cases due to the overdetection of rainy days under time-dependent missing patterns.},

              Missing rainfall data are a major limitation for distributed hydrological modeling and climate studies. Practitioners need reliable approaches that can be employed on a daily basis, often with too limited data in space to feed complex predictive models. In this study we compare different automatic approaches for missing data imputation, including geostatistical interpolation and pattern-based estimation algorithms. We introduce two pattern-based approaches based on the analysis of historical data patterns: (i) an iterative version of
              K
              -nearest neighbor (IKNN) and (ii) a new algorithm called vector sampling (VS) that combines concepts of multiple-point statistics and resampling. Both algorithms can draw estimations from variably incomplete data patterns, allowing the target dataset to be at the same time the training dataset. Tested on five case studies from Denmark, Australia, and Switzerland, the algorithms show a different performance that seems to be related to the terrain type: on flat terrains with spatially homogeneous rain events, geostatistical interpolation tends to minimize the average error, while in mountainous regions with nonstationary rainfall statistics, data mining can recover better the rainfall patterns. The VS algorithm, requiring minimal parameterization, turns out to be a convenient option for routine application on complex and poorly gauged terrains.},

	abstract = {Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.  This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader’s intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},
