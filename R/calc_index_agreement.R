#' Calculate index of agreement
#' 
#' Function to calculate index of agreement
#' 
#' The index of agreement expresses the ratio of mean square error and the potential error.
#' It expresses both the covariation and the absolute difference of target and auxiliary
#' weather station. The index of agreement can range from 0 to 1, the higher the value
#' the better the agreement of the compared objects. The index of agreement is 
#' sensitive to extreme values.

#' @param x = target observation
#' @param y = neighbor observation
#' @return index of agreement
#' @examples calc_index_agreement(x = 1:10, y = 2:11)
