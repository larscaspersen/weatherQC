#' Spatial corroboration test of temperature
#' 
#' Function to test if the target temperature is spatial coherent with neighbour
#' observations.
#' 
#' The function compares the temperature observation of the target station to the
#' observations of neighboring stations. This function is a companion test to
#' \code{\link{test_spatial_consistency}}. While the aim is similar (identify
#' observations which are not in line with neighboring observations) the testing 
#' principle is different. While \code{test_spatial_consistency} compares the weighted
#' output of linear regression to the target value, the \code{test_temperature_corroboration}
#' compares the target observation to the temperature anomaly of the station to the 
#' long term mean. The testing tolerance of \code{test_temperature_corroboration} is wider, so it is
#' less strict, but it also makes fewer demands on the shared observation of 
#' target and auxiliary weather stations, so it can be applicable where the demands
#' of \code{test_spatial_consistency} do not permit any test result at all. 
#' 
#' The testing procedure is a follows: The target observation is compared with at
#' least 3 but never more than 7 neighborliness stations within a 75 km radius.
#' Neighboring values of the target variable of the same day, but also the previous and
#' following day are included in the test to account for differences in the recording
#' protocol. For each observation and station the temperature anomaly is calculated,
#' meaning the standardized residuals of observation to the long term mean of the day of the year
#' of the respective weather station. Long term mean and standard deviation are 
#' calculated using the same principle as in \code{\link{get_longterm_mean_and_sd}}.
#' If the minimum absolute difference of the target to neighbor anomaly is larger than 
#' the default threshold of 10 degree C, then the target value is flagged by the 
#' test.

#' section 6 "Spatial consistency checks". 
#' @param weather data.frame containing a daily time series data set. 
#' It should have columns c("Year", "Month", "Day")
#' @param weather_coords numerical vector of length two. Should contain longitude and 
#' latitude (in that order) of target station in decimal format
#' @param aux_info data.frame listing the auxiliary weather stations. Should at least contain
#' the columns c("id", "Longitude", "Latitude")
#' @param aux_list named list of data.frames with daily weather obsrvations of auxiliary
#' weather stations. Names should be identical to \code{aux_info$id}. Strucuture of 
#' data.frames should be identical of \code{weather}. Data.frames do not necissarily
#' need to cover excat same time period as \code{weather}
#' @param variable a character indicating the column name of the tested variable 
#' in weathe
#' @param max_dist maximum distance in kilometers of neighbouring stations to target station to be 
#' included in the spatial corroboration test
#' @param max_station maximum number of neighbouring stations included in the test.
#' If more auxiliary stations available than \code{max_station}, then closest ones
#' are taken
#' @param min_station minimum amount of neighbouring stations for the test. If less
#' is available, then test is not carried out and automatically returns \code{FALSE}
#' for every observation
#' @param max_diff maximum difference of the lowest minimum difference of target observation
#' to neighbouring observations for temperature anomalies
#' @return logical vector of same length as \code{nrow(weather)}. Values of \code{TRUE} indicate successful test,
#' meaning that the tested variable exceeded the limits of the test and is flagged
#' as suspicious
#' @examples test_temperature_corroboration(weather = target_weather,
#' weather_coords = c(target_info$Longitude, target_info$Latidue),
#' aux_info = neighbour_info, aux_list = neighbour_list, variable = "Tmin")
